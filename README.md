Welcome to **Half-Time Stat** — the home of my passion about football and data.<br>
The aim of this project is to combine two things that bring me joy: _football_ and _data_ — and share with people the beautiful world of football stats. If you have suggestions or feedback, do not hesitate to reach out. Love you!

Sharing a bit of code written for the project:<br>
Check [Code Snippets and Visualizations](https://github.com/dav1ddramb/Half-Time-Stat-Public/tree/main/Code%20Snippets%20and%20Visualizations) for examples of code used to retrieve data, proccess it, create visualizations and explore stats<br>
_Note: a lot of that code was written in very limited time to meet my own commitment of creating posts daily, and wasn't intended for sharing originally since I work on the project alone, so it may be a bit messy when it comes to appropriate formatting and comments_
