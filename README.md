Welcome to **Half-Time Stat** — the home of my passion about football and data.<br>
The aim of this project is to combine two things that bring me joy: _football_ and _data_ — and share with people the beautiful world of football stats. If you have suggestions or feedback, do not hesitate to reach out. Love you!
